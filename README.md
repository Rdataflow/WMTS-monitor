This workflow evaluates the WMTS endpoints from [map.geo's mapviewer](https://github.com/geoadmin/web-mapviewer/tree/develop/packages/mapviewer/src/modules/menu/components/advancedTools/ImportCatalogue/external-providers.json) whether they support CRS `EPSG:3857` a.k.a. [Web Mercator Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection). The results are published on https://rdataflow.github.io/WMTS-monitor/result.txt
